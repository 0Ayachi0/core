# Big Integer

## Description

An immutable arbitrary precision integer type.

## TODO

- Once we have constants in generics, we can do `BigInt[Radix: Int]` to statically specify the radix.
- Optimize the implementation of multiplication and division by doing a case study on the length of the numbers. One example can be found [here](https://github.com/tbuktu/bigint).
