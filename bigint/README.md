# Big Integer

## Description

An immutable arbitrary precision integer type. 

## TODO

- `op_mod` is now implemented by `op_div`. Implement it separately for performance.
- From/To hex string, etc.
- Optimize the implementation of multiplication and division by doing a case study on the length of the numbers. One example can be found [here](https://github.com/tbuktu/bigint).
- Other math function, like power, sqrt, log, etc.
