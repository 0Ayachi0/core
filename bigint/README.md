An immutable arbitrary precision integer type.

## TODO

- From/To hex string, etc.
- Optimize the implementation of multiplication and division by doing a case study on the length of the numbers. One example can be found [here](https://github.com/tbuktu/bigint).
- Other math function, like power, sqrt, log, etc.
